#    
# 2. Activate virtual environment:
#    Windows: covid_env\Scripts\activate
#    Linux/Mac: source covid_env/bin/activate
#    
# 3. Install requirements:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#    
# 4. Run the pipeline:
#    python main.py

# Package Versions Tested:
# Python: 3.8+, 3.9+, 3.10+
# pandas: 1.3.5, 1.4.x, 1.5.x
# scikit-learn: 1.0.2, 1.1.x, 1.2.x
