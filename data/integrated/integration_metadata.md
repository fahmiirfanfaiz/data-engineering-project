# COVID-19 Jakarta Dataset - Data Integration Report
Generated: 2025-09-26 03:24:34

## Input Dataset
- Source: covid19_jakarta_mei2020_cleaned_basic.csv
- Original shape: (269, 17)
- Original features: 11 COVID-19 variables

## Integration Process Applied

### 1. Correlation Analysis
- Found high correlations (>0.95) between ODP/PDP variables
- Identified moderate correlations (0.5-0.7) requiring feature engineering
- Total correlation pairs analyzed: 55

### 2. Covariance Analysis
- Eigenvalue analysis performed for dimensionality insights
- PC1 explains ~79.9% of variance
- Standardized covariance matrix used for feature scaling insights

### 3. Redundancy Handling Strategy
- Domain-informed approach: Medical data preserved for interpretability
- No variables dropped (all medically significant)
- Redundancy handled through composite feature engineering

### 4. Feature Engineering Applied
- Rate/Ratio features: 5 basic + 3 advanced
- Geographic features: 5 (kecamatan encoding & aggregates)
- Risk indices: 3 (composite risk, severity, transmission)
- Temporal features: 2 (year, month extraction)
- Quality features: 2 (completeness, consistency flags)

## Output Datasets

### 1. Full Integrated Dataset
- File: covid19_jakarta_mei2020_integrated_full.csv

- Use case: Complete analysis, exploration

### 2. Analysis-Ready Dataset  
- File: covid19_jakarta_mei2020_integrated_analysis.csv
- Shape: (269, 30)
- Contains: Essential features for epidemiological analysis
- Use case: Statistical analysis, visualization, reporting

### 3. ML-Ready Dataset
- File: covid19_jakarta_mei2020_integrated_ml_ready.csv
- Shape: (269, 26)
- Contains: Numeric features only, encoded categoricals
- Use case: Machine learning, predictive modeling

## Data Quality Metrics
- Missing values: 0
- Infinite values: 0
- Data completeness: 100% across all feature categories
- Consistency checks: Passed

## Key Engineered Features Performance
Top correlations with COVID-19 outcomes:
- kecamatan_avg_positif → positif: r = 0.984
- total_surveillance → positif: r = 0.809
- composite_risk_index: Mean = 0.186

## Redundancy Resolution
- Strategy: Conservative feature engineering instead of dropping
- Rationale: Medical domain requires interpretable features
- Result: Enhanced feature space while preserving all original information

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Data Reduction: Apply PCA/feature selection if needed
2. Data Transformation: Normalization, scaling for ML algorithms  
3. Validation: Cross-validate engineered features with domain experts
